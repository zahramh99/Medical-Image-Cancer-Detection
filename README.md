# Cancer Image Detection using Deep Learning
This project implements a deep learning model to detect metastatic cancer in medical image patches. The model is trained to analyze small image patches derived from larger digital pathology scans, helping in the detection of cancerous cells.


## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a cancer image detection algorithm using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process histopathology images and classify whether they contain metastatic tissue.

### Key Features:
- Use of deep learning with PyTorch to process medical images.
- GPU compatibility check and usage for faster model training.
- Extensive data preprocessing, augmentation, and training pipeline setup.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch and related libraries
- Additional dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` (optional)

### Installing Required Libraries

You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:
